# Project Dashboard


Welcome to the project dashboard! This directory contains the Python code used for the exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted prior to uploading the CSV files into PowerBI.

## 1. Overview

In this project, the Python scripts are designed to:
- Perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
- Clean and transform the data as needed for the analysis.
- For performance reasons and to showcase my skills, I also performed calculations and data transformations in PowerBI.

## 2. Python Script
**`ExploratoryDataAnalysis_ProjectDashboard.py`**  
- Contains the main code for performing the EDA. This script includes data loading, cleaning, and transformation steps.

### 3. Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.12.0 ir higher is required.
- Python packages
  - Install the necessary Python packages using:
   ````bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt   

## 4. Running the EDA Script
Run the eda.py script to perform the exploratory data analysis:

  ````bash
  python ExploratoryDataAnalysis_ProjectDashboard.py
